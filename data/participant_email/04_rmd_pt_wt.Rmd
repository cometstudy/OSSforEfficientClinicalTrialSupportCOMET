#### Reminders

* Remember to bring your exercise log and record your exercise immediately

* Remember to start and stop your Fitbit watch at the beginning and end of exercise sessions
  + Start your watch before warm-up and after cool-down to ensure you get 150 minutes of total activity

* Weight training can be in the form of resistance bands, machine weights, free weights in very limited situations with appropriate direct or indirect supervision, or body weight. Weight training sessions are expected to last about 35 minutes

* Rest no less than 1 minute and no more than 2 minutes between each exercise set. 

* Be sure to focus on strict posture and a full, comfortable range of motion. 

* From time to time, you may miss a supervised session due to illness, travel, or other commitments. For any missed sessions, it is important to follow some rules regarding rescheduling: 
  + A maximum of supervised sessions per week consistent with the frequency of supervised sessions at that point in the study
  + No more than 2 sets of repetitions for any exercise per day
  + No more than 2 days of WT in a week
