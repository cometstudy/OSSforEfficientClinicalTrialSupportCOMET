#### Reminders

* Remember to bring your exercise log and record your exercise immediately

* Remember to start and stop your Fitbit watch at the beginning and end of exercise sessions
  + For endurance sessions, try to get all "Target Weekly Exercise Minutes" within your heart rate range, so start the watch after warm-up and end before cool-down
  + For resistance sessions, feel free to start the watch before your warm-up to ensure you get 75 minutes of exercise

* Walking is the encouraged mode of endurance exercise either using a walking track or treadmill. However, you are allowed to use other types of endurance exercise equipment. Acceptable modes of exercise include but are not limited to the following: 
  + Bike (Upright, Recumbent, or Airdyne) 
  + Elliptical 
  + Rower 
  + Stair Climber or Stepper (Upright or Recumbent)
  
* Weight training can be in the form of resistance bands, machine weights, free weights in very limited situations with appropriate direct or indirect supervision, or body weight. Weight training sessions are expected to last about 35 minutes

* Rest no less than 1 minute and no more than 2 minutes between each exercise set. 

* Be sure to focus on strict posture and a full, comfortable range of motion. 

* You may do a maximum of 60 minutes in any session and spread out the endurance exercise minutes over no less than 3 days a week, and preferably no more than 5 days.

* Ideally, you will reach 30 minutes per endurance exercise session by the third week of the intervention and this will be maintained for the duration of the intervention. 

* From time to time, you may miss a supervised session due to illness, travel, or other commitments. For any missed sessions, it is important to follow some rules regarding rescheduling: 
  + A maximum of supervised sessions per week consistent with the frequency of supervised sessions at that point in the study
  + A maximum of 60 minutes per supervised session per day 
  + A maximum of 3 Supervised sessions per week 
  + No more than 2 sets of repetitions for any exercise per day
  + No more than 2 days of WT in a week
