We will be looking at whether different kinds of physical activity support brain health. I'd like to give you an overview of the study and then talk about how we determine if you are eligible. Please stop me as we go, if you have any questions. <br /><br />This study is testing whether exercise affects brain health in older adults. Many people, as they age, begin to notice changes in how they think and remember. Research has found that physical activity is one of the most promising methods for improving brain health. We hope this study will help transform health-care recommendations in the future. </span></p> <p><span style=""color: blue;"">As a requirement of the study, we will be asking you to complete several clinic visits. The first visit includes consent and a memory and thinking test. In total the visit takes about 4 hours. D</span><span style=""color: blue;"">uring consent we will talk about everything involved in the study. This is a good time to ask absolutely any questions. Consent takes about an hour an a half. During the memory and thinking test, you will be asked to do some assessments using paper and pencils or a computer. Our staff will help administer these and answer any questions you may have. The memory and thinking test will last approximately 2.5 hours, bringing the full visit to 4 hours. We will give you breaks between tests if you get tired. You will repeat the memory and thinking testing half way through the study and again at the end of the study.<br /></span></p> <p><span style=""color: blue;"">The next visit includes fitness testing. In this session, we will ask you to perform several fitness assessments including walking on a treadmill while breathing into a tube. This will be done with trained specialists. We will also collect blood from you, measure your muscle, bone, fat, and strength. Total time for this session is approximately 3 - 3.5 hours. You will repeat this testing again at the end of the study.<br /></span></p> <p><span style=""color: blue;"">The last baseline visit, is an MRI Scan . This session obtains images of your brain. No radiation is involved in these scans and they are completely safe. This session will likely take about 1.5 hour but you will only be in the MRI machine for about 45 minutes. You will also repeat this testing at the end of the study.</span></p> <p><span style=""color: blue;"">After completing baseline testing, you will complete one full year of exercise (a full 52 weeks) under the supervision of a personal trainer.  You will be randomized  to one of four groups by a computer with the study coordinator (this is a good opportunity to introduce the study coordinator). This process is completely random and none of the tests or the study coordinator can influence which group you go to, so it's best to mentally prepare to go to any group. All groups are supervised by trained exercise specialists who will monitor your progress and ensure you are exercising safely. The groups are:<br /><br />1. A group that will do endurance exercise (like walking or cycling) at a moderate intensity for 150 minutes per week <br /><br />2. A group that will do resistance training (like lifting weights) two days a week in addition to yoga and stretching 3 days a week<br /><br />3. A group that will do both the endurance and resistance training each week<br /><br />4. A group that will do toning, balance, and stretching training each week<br /><br />All participants (regardless of the group assignment) will be asked to exercise each week for one year. And again, you will be supervised by study-certified trainers. <br /><br />After 6 months of being in the study, some of the tests will be repeated. After the 12-month period is complete all of these sessions will be repeated. All participants will be compensated for completing these research clinic visits, up to $520 for the completion of all visits. Between the baseline testing and exercise, you will be in the study about 15 months.<br /></span></p></div>",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Note: If the participant does not  have a cell phone to call the study staff when they arrive, please instruct the participant to call the study staff before he/she leaves home with the anticipated time of arrival and the color/make of the car so the study staff can be waiting for the participant in the parking lot.

•	You will not be allowed anyone to accompany you to the visit to limit the spread of COVID-19

1.	Tell them that you will relay this information to Dr. ________ (PI) and the team to obtain their guidance on whether any adjustments should be made for the study visit and that a study team member will follow up with them.
2.	Tell them they should contact their primary care provider if they feel sick or call their local health department if they think they have been exposed.
3.	If the participant asks for recommendations on what they should do, refer the participant to their Primary Care Provider for questions.
4.	Notify the study coordinator (unless you are the study coordinator).
5.	Update the study appointment by attaching the phone screening form for reference.
