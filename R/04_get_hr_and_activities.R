#' @title Retrieving and storing all exercise data
#' 
#' @description 
#' This script reads in fitbit_users (csv file of fitbit users and keys)
#' Checks the state of the fitbit_users, and refreshes if need be. 
#' The script runs only for active participants 
#' For all active participants, the script checks file structure
#' Summary hr logs are saved under data/raw/hr_data
#' Intraday hr data are saved under data/raw/hr_data/intraday
#' Summary activity data logs are suved under data/raw/activities_data
#' If the correct file structure is not present, an intraday hr folder is created 
#' and a summary csv file is created (first date is randomization date) 
#' If correct structure is present, a for loop is created for the number of days between 
#' the last transfer (to summary csv) and last data sync
#' All data retrieval and storage occurs in the for loop

#' The for loop analyzes each day's intraday hr data and appends a row to summary csv
#' If the user did not wear a watch NA is returned
#' If the user did wear a watch, the number of minutes above moderate is returned
#' Moderate is determined by 40% of karvonen .4*(max_hr - rest_hr) + rest_hr for all groups
#' This is to capture all activity above 40% intensity to categorize MVPA, as not all groups are 
#' assigned target heart rates. 
#' Wear-time validation will also be stored on this spreadsheet.
#' 
#' @section Activities: 
# Within Fitbit, the types of tagged exercise can be modified
# Upon watch initialization, I'm going to edit the Fitbit to have the following three options
# These options are all different than Auto Recognized Exercises (walk, run, outdoor bike, elliptical, sports, aerobic workout, swimming)
# Yoga = Stretching
# Workout = Aerobic
# Weights = Resistance
# We will train participants to tag these when they do exercise
# The summary activity log will include the type of exercise, duration, minutes of moderate, minutes of vigorous, and average
# Duration will be capped at 90 minutes for an exercise session in case a participant forgets to turn off their watch
# The lines of code that do this are found in 116-117
# Moderate, vigorous and average are obtained by comparing the start/end time of each activity with the intraday hr data
# In a later script, I still need to determine how we categorize exercise -> where do we get it from, what counts, etc.
#' 
#' @section Development:
#' 5.12.21 fitbit_user and COMET REDCAP are combined by fitbit_users$id and comet$comet_study_id - no safeguards are in place \cr
#' 5.13.21 Line 76: Set hr filter to be on fitbit_users sheet -> need to change to REDCap db \cr
#' 5.18.21 Line 31: Redefine active participants according to study - done \cr
#' 5.28.21 To Do: develop a failsafe if a pt forgets to end activity session - done \cr
#' 8.4.21 Needed to update hrr_min and hrr_max locations \cr
#' 9.15.21 Fixed error in refreshing tokens \cr
#' 10.27.21 Adding in weartime validation to hr section JC \cr
#' 12.1.21 Updated hr to ex_forloop and ex_averaging to be 40% intensity JC \cr
#' 1.12.22 Added the email error notification for watches that are syncing but not collecting HR JC \cr
#' 1.17.22 Added in notification that max heart rate is missing. JC \cr
#' 2.1.22 Changed maximum activity duration to 60 minutes JC \cr
#' 2.2.22 Changed active participants to be anyone past their MRI visit JC \cr
#' 5.5.22 File has been checked for potential date issues. Nothing obvious. JC \cr
#' 5.10.22 Added TryCatch to last_sync to catch API call errors and send an email. JC \cr
#' 5.11.22 Added testing to prevent emails from spamming coordinators. JC \cr
#' 5.11.22 Working on error thrown when HR is turned off and an activity is recorded.
#' Changed initialization of time_in_zone = NA, time_over_zone = NA, average = NA from time_in_zone = 0, time_over_zone = 0, average = NA.
#' If HR is turned off and an activity is recorded, the for loop looking for HR during that exercise will be skipped. If statement added. JC \cr
#' 5.19.22 Added condition to TryCatch implemented on 5.10.22 to deal with fitbits that aren't set up until first day at gym. JC \cr
#' 5.19.22 Added "store device data" to store what type of tracker pts are using on daily basis. JC \cr
#' 5.20.22 Updated store device data if statement. JC \cr
#' 5.20.22 Added HR Error module. Participants get automated email if their steps are syncing but hr isnt. JC \cr
#' 6.22.22 Changed device data log error messaging if statement. JC \cr
#' 9.22.22 Updated HR Error module to include Charge 5's. JC \cr
#' 9.22.22 Updated the hr_not_working criteria. Emails were being triggered when a watch recorded very low step counts (<50 steps) and no HR data. 
#' I'm assuming this is caused by random watch movement throughout the day without any actual wear time. To fix this issue, I changed the criteria
#' to require >100 steps to change the hr_not_working marker. JC \cr
#' 11.8.22 Added the check Fitbit exercise shortcuts module. JC \cr
#' 11.16.22 We started using time_in_zone for adherence data. Time_in_zone and time_over_zone were usingthe total duration time. So if a participant logged a session over 60 minutes, the zone time could be
#' considerably longer. I fixed that for on today. So there will be errors before. The best example was a activity from #3 on 12/15/21. She had 90 minutes duration and 140 minutes in zone. We might re-run all
#' of the activity data to get hr data for the core & Fusion group. If we do, that will fix this issue. JC \cr
#' 1.3.23 Added the personal trainers on the heart rate error auto-email. JC \cr
#' 3.27.2023: Changed startDate in activities_log from iDate to date format. JC \cr
#' 3.27.23: Added missing_device to deal with Rstudio upgrade. This converts the device data call into a T or F statement to be used below. JC \cr


#' 
#' @section Errors:
#' 5.11.22 Started section. JC \cr
#' 5.11.22 A more serious error presented. As of writing, the affected section is on line 223
#' The activities data frame captures daily activities through the fitbit API. 
#' A for-loop cycles through the hr dataframe (daily intraday hr), to calculate how many minutes
#' the participant spend in and above their hr zone. This for loop would throw an error because
#' no HR is available. This program was fixed by adding a hr_not_working watcher value and initializing
#' time_in_zone and time_over_zone to NA. If a participant's HR gets shut off on their fitbit, the for 
#' loop appending hr values during a workout session will be skipped and NA will be returned. One thing
#' to note is that if a participant is not in an aerobic group (aerobic or combo), NA will also be returned
#' for these values as they do not have a target hr zone. JC \cr
