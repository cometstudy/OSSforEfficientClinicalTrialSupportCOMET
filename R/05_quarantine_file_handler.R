#' @section Development notes:
#' 10.7.21: Error found in file handling. overlap_frozen shows identical advisor.xsl files when trying to copy data. Need to
#' edit logic of overlap_frozen in some way. Consulting Eric before continuing. \cr
#' 10.11.21 Jon added short_name to already_working_files, etc to deal with repeat advisor.tsl in each folder. \cr
#' 11.30.21 Issued preliminary fix to ongoing overlapping files issue. Summary of issue: NIH files do not have a folder so short_name convention does not work.
#' eCog files have a folder structure so short name convention does work, but basename shows overlapping files - advisor.xsl. Preliminary fix is to compare basenames.
#' If basenames are overlapping, look at file name. If it is advisor.xsl, change overlapping back to false. JC \cr
#' 12.1.21 Updated dxa quarantine. DXAs are saved in UTF-16LE format. readlines recognizes a coded line. DXA is imported and changed encoding. Then
#' exported to relevant directories. JC \cr
#' 12.6.21 Added in code to copy pdf version of NIH Assessment Report to the frozen directory JC \cr
#' 4.28.22 Updated VO2 transfer. \cr
#' 5.3.22 Updated DXA transfer. Took language from 05_get_copy_electronic_data JC \cr
#' 5.24.22 First T2 cogs were uploaded. This caused issues with the frozen files / to handle language (checking for duplicate files).
#' Cog files are uploaded either as NIH files (csv or pdf) or VCAP within a larger folder. The folder vs. single file, makes checking 
#' for overlapping files hard. T2 basename files are named the same as T1 files in VCAP. So uploaded files are now separated into 
#' file vs. folder and overlaps are checked depending on type. JC  \cr
#' 5.26.22 A GXT check has been added before quarantining. If GXT files are mislabeled or do not contain all relevant info
#' a message is sent to the coordinators. JC \cr
#' 6.16.22 Added MRI structure to non_cog. MRI task files are tranfered in folders. non_cog_files are separated
#' into folders to transfer (non_cog_folder_to_move) and non_cog_files (non_cog_to_do). JC \cr
#' 7.19.22 Updated the overlapping email function to send a single email with all overlapping files. JC \cr
#' 9.13.22 Occasionally the wrong file types will be uploaded into a to_handle folder, i.e. an outlook email instead of the .csv
#' files for the NIH Toolbox. I created supported file types. If a file type is not supported an error email is sent so that it can 
#' be identified on corrected. This occurs for both non_cog_to_do files and nih_files JC \cr
#' 11.8.22 Corrected message that gets sent when overlap_frozen_files == T. Actually includes file names. JC \cr
#' 
#' @description 
#' This script checks to see what source documentation has been transferred to the P drive "external data directory" by
#' the study team or raters, and puts one copy in a data archive and puts another copy
#' in the primary data storage folder for use.
